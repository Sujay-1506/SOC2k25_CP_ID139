Welcome! This repository contains the weekly materials shared in our WhatsApp group, mirrored here in the resources folder as part of our Competitive Programming journey.

We have created a Codeforces group (**link : https://codeforces.com/group/5cfZbpvx6U**), we share weekly assignments consisting 10-15 questions in this group.
